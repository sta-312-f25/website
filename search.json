These are graded for completion.\n\n\nIn-class worked problems\nOn most Wednesdays, class time will be devoted to group work on the assigned exercise problems. Each week, you will be placed in groups of 2–3 students. One problem from the previous week’s homework will be randomly assigned to your group. One member of the group will then present the solution to the class. Over the course of the semester, each student is required to present at least three times.\nGrading Rubric:\n1 – Minimal: Attempted presentation but showed little preparation; major errors or unclear explanation.\n2 – Adequate: Mostly correct solution with a few minor errors.\n3 – Strong: Fully correct solution; clear, accurate, and organized explanation; addressed the key steps of the solution; responded adequately to questions.\n4 – Exceptional: Outstanding explanation that was clear, engaging, and insightful; demonstrated strong understanding and possibly connected the problem to broader course ideas.\nMost presentations will earn a 2 or 3, with 4s reserved for especially clear and helpful explanations.\n\n\nMidterm\nWe will have one in-class midterm.\n\n\nFinal Project\nA cumulative project worth integrating skills and knowledge from across the course.",
